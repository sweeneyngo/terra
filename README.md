An item catalog/tracker for Terraria (as of [v1.4.4+](https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/1.4.4.9)) for "Zenith"-type worlds!


## Where to start?
For starters, search for an item you're thinking of (maybe, terra?).\

## Building
```bash
pnpm install && pnpm run dev 
```

## API
terra does support an [open API](https://terra-api.fly.dev), but documentation is still underway. \
For the time being, check out the development @ [terra-api](https://github.com/sweeneyngo/terra-api").

## So, why?

For a "blazingly" fast, flexible interface with minimal/no deps. 

After completing my very first vanilla Terraria run (kudos to my boyfriend!), \
we wanted to shoot for the elusive "true" 100%, which involves all items, collectibles, monsters (bestiary), and permanent buffs.\
Achieving this, sadly, is a [**monumental**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Terraria/comments/9bdva0/100_terraria_all_3862_obtainable_items_collected/) pain. \
Unfortunately, I'm pretty restless for a method to the madness, so I built it myself!

Check it out! [ðŸ”—](https://ifuxyl.dev)
